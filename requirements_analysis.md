# Requirements Analysis Summary

## Document Analysis Overview

Based on the provided documents, I've identified the following key systems and requirements:

### 1. Market Intelligence Platform (MIP)
**Core Purpose**: AI-driven options-centric trading intelligence system
**Key Features**:
- Multi-agent AI architecture (FinBERT, GPT-4, Llama 2-7B, TFT)
- Real-time market analysis and sentiment tracking
- Options strategy generation and risk management
- Virtual trading engine with P&L tracking
- Explainable AI for trade recommendations
- Brokerage integration for execution

### 2. Agent Transformation Engine (ATE)
**Core Purpose**: Automated analysis and planning for AI agent implementations
**Key Features**:
- 4-step analysis pipeline for codebase transformation
- Automatic identification of agentic opportunities
- Business case generation with ROI modeling
- Technical architecture specification
- Implementation roadmap generation

## Synthesis: Unified Agentic Implementation Strategy

The goal is to create an "agent" that can ingest any codebase and present a detailed plan and path towards agentic AI transformation. This combines:

1. **MIP's multi-agent expertise** for complex AI orchestration
2. **ATE's analysis capabilities** for codebase understanding and transformation planning
3. **Business value focus** for ROI-driven recommendations

## Core Requirements Identified

### Functional Requirements
1. **Codebase Analysis Engine**: Multi-language parsing, dependency analysis, architecture recognition
2. **Business Domain Mapping**: Automatic identification of business functions and processes
3. **Agentic Opportunity Detection**: AI-powered identification of automation opportunities
4. **Multi-Agent Architecture Design**: Specialized agents for different analysis tasks
5. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed technical specifications and roadmaps
6. **Business Case Generation**: ROI modeling and executive reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Handle large codebases (500K+ lines) efficiently
2. **Accuracy**: 70-95% accuracy across different analysis phases
3. **Scalability**: Support concurrent analysis and multi-tenant architecture
4. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
5. **Integration**: Support for major development tools and platforms

### Key Capabilities Needed
- Document understanding and analysis
- Code parsing and semantic analysis
- Business process identification
- AI agent orchestration
- Technical architecture design
- Implementation planning and documentation
- Business value modeling
